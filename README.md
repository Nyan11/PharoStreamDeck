### Basic WebSocket communication
This project shows a Web page programmed in HTML and JavaScript can communicate with a server programmed in Pharo, by using a WebSocket and JSON data.

### Stream Deck Pharo Profile
This project shows how Stream Deck buttons can interact with the Pharo IDE by using some dedicated keyboard shortcuts.

### YearSelector
This project shows how a plugin made in Pharo can interact with the Stream Deck, where values can be selected with the plugin (and the dedicated Stream Deck profile available alongside it). \
A JavaScript version as well as a Pharo one exists, each one having the same objective and outcome, separated in their own folders.
