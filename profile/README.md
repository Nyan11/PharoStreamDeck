## Installation
Download the file, then double-click it. If the Stream Deck application is installed on your computer, the profile will be imported on it with the name "Pharo".

Note : some of the keyboard shortcuts used in this profile require the SuperMacro plugin (available [here](https://github.com/BarRaider/streamdeck-supermacro), or directly via the Stream Deck store). As a matter of fact, some Pharo keyboard shortcuts require simultaneous alphabetical keys pushes, a type of action which cannot be done with the current implementation of the keyboard shortcut action provided by Elgato by default, available in the System portion of the action list. As such, if the SuperMacro plugin isn't installed in your Stream Deck application, some actions will be represented by a small interrogation point, and will only show the text "Super Macro"
